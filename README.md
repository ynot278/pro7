#### Tony Pham Assignment 2 Remake for Assignment 7

#Changes made - instead of reading from file for sleep time and repeat factor, i used a random number generator for those variables and use them in shared memory
        while working on the project in replit, sometime would not work.

        logfile.txt does get created and write to the file, will show an example in github.

#Shared memory allocate and attach along with deallocate and deattach is working.
